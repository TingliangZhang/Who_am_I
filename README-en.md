## Summary of some scientific research projects (all in one or a total of one)

### Misaka: Cluster software and hardware development platform for human-computer interaction research

This work introduces a visual test platform for algorithm evaluation, and it is also an open source platform for developing desktop entity cluster interactive interfaces. Includes a set of custom-designed 3 omnidirectional wheel robots (each with a diameter of 10 cm), supporting software, and developer version PCB. From the level of hardware and communication protocol, it realizes the complete decentralization of software and hardware, and provides a complete hardware test and visualization platform for consensus algorithms.

The main innovation points are:

-Using distributed algorithms in the economic dispatch of the power market, decentralization can enhance the reliability of the power system.
-Use the cluster visualization platform to explore new ways to display algorithms.
-Developed a complete communication architecture for cluster communication development and testing.
-The more mature integrated mobile platform cluster system creates unlimited possibilities for human-computer interaction.

### SUSI: A tool for self-awareness, auxiliary treatment and seeking help

SUSI is a safe, friendly and portable tool for preventing and assisting patients with mood disorders in self-awareness, auxiliary treatment and seeking help. It encourages people who are experiencing emotional problems to confess and face their inner vulnerability in a suitable way, thereby helping them to vent and conduct cognitive reassessment. SUSI can be attached to the back of the mobile phone, and the posture when used is similar to making a phone call, so it will not cause unnecessary embarrassment even in public. SUSI is an offline tool, so users do not need to worry about data leakage. By recording through SUSI, users can view the emotional data statistical analysis of historical records to understand their own emotional change trends, and help users find the reasons for personal emotional changes through word frequency analysis. In addition, through SUSI, users can choose appropriate trusted sharing objects when they need help, and use automatically generated appropriate language for different intimate relationships to share, so as to avoid repetitive narration and cause secondary harm, providing Narrate information more effectively so you can seek help from others. Our fundamental purpose is not to solve the patient's current difficulties, but to help users return to normal life through a self-awareness method.

### Teleoperation robot based on Vive VR

With the development of robotics, there are more and more application scenarios for robots. However, at present, automatic control robots cannot perform most complex tasks, especially tasks that need to be adapted to emergency situations such as emergency rescue and disaster relief. In this case, teleoperation robots are required.

At present, the remote control of the mechanical arm generally adopts the handle or keyboard control method, and the monitoring method is generally that the camera image is displayed on the monitor, which is very different from the on-site operation.

To this end, we have developed four iterative versions of the system for remotely controlling robots with VR equipment with very different hardware architectures, as well as a matching three-dimensional real-time scene acquisition and image transmission system, so that operators can have an immersive operating experience. Significantly reduce costs while reducing latency

### NANO Robot - Artificial intelligence education kit based on Nvidia Jetson NANO

Aiming at the current shortage of high-end artificial intelligence STEAM educational resources on the market, a set of artificial intelligence education kits based on Nvidia Jetson NANO, a customized version of the Ubuntu1804LTS system, and OpenCV/TensorFlow/CUDA have been developed. A typical product is a smart car kit, which allows young people to realize lane line detection, visual obstacle avoidance, scene recognition, face ID, image segmentation and other functions through simple operations.

Combining command-line code programming with visual graphic programming, interactive programming through a web browser, with tutorials from basic motion to artificial intelligence, easy to use, simple to understand.

### Smart meter--Non-invasive load decomposition device based on NILMTK

At present, there is no practical solution for smart meters with non-intrusive load monitoring functions. The main reason is that there are too many types of electrical appliances and the power characteristics are not obvious. Therefore, most of the solutions are based on online neural network analysis, and all of them will be collected. The data is uploaded to the cloud server, processed by GPU/CPU on the server, and fed back to the user or power provider. This not only requires adding expensive high-bandwidth communication solutions to the product, but also occupies a lot of computing power, and the user's data security is also at risk.

This project proposes an algorithm that does not rely on neural networks, which can run on cheap and energy-saving embedded chips. At the same time, a complete smart meter solution is designed to perfectly integrate the on-board system into the meter. All data is processed in the meter. Only the required parameters are uploaded to the grid company. The user can decide whether to sell other data. Results involving sensitive information are only stored locally.

It can distinguish the time period that high-power appliances such as induction cookers, air conditioners, and microwave ovens are turned on each day, which can provide a data basis for household demand-side responses.

### Barrier-free travel light reminder device based on PlaceCNN

People with inconvenient legs and feet may have some safety problems when traveling due to problems such as moving speed. By using the neural network trained by PlaceCNN, the current scene information can be obtained, and there are different sound and light prompt strategies.

### Research on wearable products based on flexible LED array

Cooperation project with the Academy of Fine Arts. Flexible LED, as a kind of bendable and highly robust special circuit, provides a new form of possibility for artistic expression. This work proposes a solution for a flexible LED array based on ordinary cloth.

### Cooperate with the new media team and the Academy of Fine Arts on the "Automatic Light Painting Drone"

The drone carries a high-brightness RGB-LED, with the aid of GPS and optical flow, flying with programmable lights and trajectories, and long-exposure shooting with a ground camera to obtain light painting works in the sky.

### Coilgun: Multi-stage Gauss coil electromagnetic acceleration device

A device that accelerates the load through electromagnetic interaction force. A large current of 100A flows in the coil in a very short time, and a strong magnetic field is generated to accelerate the small iron ball. The photoelectric gate detects that the small iron ball passes through the midpoint of the coil. The acceleration of the grade coil can make the ferromagnetic medium obtain a lot of energy.
